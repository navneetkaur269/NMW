<h3>make it seems like he's the best of hypnotists</h3>
<p1>Hypnotherapy products are a system of changing behavior and attitudes by
 communicating to your subconscious mind (rather than your conscious self) the
 types of changes you want to have.  The major benefit of using hypnosis is that
 it does not rely so much on your self awareness, willpower or ability to make 
decisions and take actions for yourself. Rather, they create a relaxed psychological
 condition where certain processes (such as focused attention, increased suggestibility
 and conscious critical analysis) are changed.  The relaxed state or hypnotic trance 
allows for a situation where you become open to the influence of the hypnosis recording
 – change occurs in the unconscious and new behaviors and beliefs result.</p1>
